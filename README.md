# New York State of Health Spreadsheets and Help

New York's "Obamacare"
[health insurance exchange website](https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/individual)
_really_ sucks.  Basic information is missing or hard to find.
This repository is an independent attempt to work around some of
the shortcomings.

## 2016 Open Enrollment Dates
* Starts: November 1
* Deadline for Coverage Starting January 1: December 15
* Ends: January 31
* Medicaid and Child Health Plus: available all year long

## Spreadsheets

The exchange gives me 88 health insurance plans to choose from.
That's a _lot_ of stuff to think about.  But the site only allows
comparing three plans at a time, and it only compares a few datapoints.

As a computer programmer and data lover I kept thinking
"For heaven's sake, give me a spreadsheet!!!"
But the exchange's website doesn't seem to have that option.
So I took it upon myself.  Behold!

* [Westchester County, Family Plans, Unsubsidized](https://github.com/convissor/new_york_state_of_health_spreadsheet/blob/master/2016/data/westchester_family_unsubsidized.csv)

To download a given "spreadsheet," click it's link, above, then click the
"Raw" button that's right above the data table.

## Tools for Extracting the Data

## Independent

This is an independent project.  The State of New York and the various
insurance companies have nothing to do with it.

## Questions?

All questions should be addressed to the health insurance exchange:

* Phone: 855-355-5777
* TTY: 800-662-1220
* https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/individual

Of course, if you're a computer programmer or an employer thereof,
that's another story! :)  To help out, fork the project and send
in pull requests.  If you need a solid, senior developer,
