# New York State of Health Spreadsheet and Help

New York's "Obamacare"
[health insurance exchange website](https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/individual)
_really_ sucks.  Basic information is missing or hard to find.
This repository is an independent attempt to work around some of
the shortcomings.

## Spreadsheet

The exchange has 88 health insurance plans for me to choose from.
That's a _lot_ of stuff to think about.  But the site only allows
comparing three plans at a time, and it only compares a few datapoints.
I quickly came to the conclusion "For heaven's sake, give me a spreadsheet!"



## Tools for Extracting the Data

## Independent

This is an independent project.  The State of New York and the various
insurance companies have nothing to do with it.

## Questions?

All questions should be addressed to the health insurance exchange:

* Phone: 855-355-5777
* TTY: 800-662-1220

Of course, if you're a computer programmer looking to help with this
project or you have a job offer, that's another story! :)  To help out,
fork the project and send in pull requests.  If you need a solid, senior
